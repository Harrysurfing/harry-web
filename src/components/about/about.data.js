During my current job I had the chance to work on several web development projects for our internal CRM system and found it very interesting. I have been enjoying building up frontend projects ever since. I have good grasp of Javascript ES6, React, Redux and CSS, and I welcome any opportunity that can take my skills and project experience to the next level.",
